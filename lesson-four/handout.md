Lesson Four - Bootstrap
----------------

###Topics

####"The" CSS Framework

Bootstrap is the most widely used CSS framework available today.  We'll discuss why and what Bootstrap is and why it's so useful.  Below are just a few of those things:

- Bootstrap is designed to be mobile first, which means if used properly your site should work on mobile devices as well as desktops
- Bootstrap provides CSS styles for almost all of the base HTML elements
- Bootstrap provides you with a bunch of things that HTML and CCS doesn't support out of the box
- Bootstrap comes with bootstrap.js, which provides a few additional goodies such as a carousel
- Bootstrap uses a row column layout system
- Bootstrap has great documentation

####Working with Bootstrap

We'll convert our site from lesson one into a bootstrap site.  We'll demonstrate how simple it can be.  We'll do the following:

- Change our navigation to the Bootstrap version
- Make use of Bootstrap's row column layout
- Change the classes we're using to bootstrap classes

####Bootstrap and Less

Bootstrap was originally created using {less} and is still maintained in {less} today.  We'll take a quick look at the {less} source for Bootstrap and see how easy it is to change things using their variables.

####Overriding Bootstrap

We'll also look at one strategy for overriding bootstrap's behavior when that is necessary.  This approach is better than changing bootstrap itself whenever possible, since this should allow us to more easily upgrade to new versions of bootstrap without having to remerge our changes.
