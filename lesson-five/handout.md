####One way to two way data binding!

Knockout.js is one of the most popular two way data binding libraries available today for JavaScript developers.  We'll discuss the following about Knockout.js and two way data binding in general:

- When to use two way data binding and why
- What is Knockout.js and why we would use it over another two way binding library
- Can we use jQuery and Knockout.js together
- Knockout's binding syntax
- Knockout ES5 plugin
- Using knockout for validation
- Where to go to find out more about Knockout and binding examples

####Working with Knockout.js

We'll add Knockout.js binding to our website.  We'll demonstrate how simple it can be.  We'll do the following:

- Implement Knockout.js two data binding using the original knockout syntax (which works on older browsers)
- Add knockout validation

####The Changing Pattern

We'll discuss the MVVM pattern and why it's what everyone is doing these days.
